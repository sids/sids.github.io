		<description>Umm.. looks more like a theory kosteen. Can I rephrase it like this? 

Given an infinite sequence of numbers, can we guarantee that we can find sums of subsequences that map onto all possible values of k? The mapping is in terms of multiples of k or k itself, if the sum is prime.,

What I am thinking is, given an infinite sequence of numbers, start at a random location and go on computing the sums. Each sum will be a multiple of some &#039;k&#039; or the other (or prime). So, it is possible to at least one subsequence whose sum is divisible by a given &#039;k&#039;.

I don&#039;t know if this is valid at all. That aside, what is also not clear in your kosteen is: is it about being able to say that there is such a sequence or *finding* such a sequence (and then of course, saying that there is a sequence).</description>
