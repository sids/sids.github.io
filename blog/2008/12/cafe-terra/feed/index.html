		<description>Hi Sids,

This is Ranjeet - one of the owners of Cafe Tarra. Thank you for a nice review and also your patronage!

Like you, I too was a patron of the Cafe in its previous incarnation (then called De Lekkerbek) and I too got worried when the place appeared empty! So a friend of mine and I bought the place :-)

Anyway, as it happens, we do make a small profit now and enjoy eating there a couple of times a week. The crowded times are Sat/Sun mornings and at other times people treacle in. But don&#039;t worry we will not close the place :-)

All the best,
Ranjeet

p.s. If you are a foodie then let me know any cool recipes that you may be aware of.</description>
