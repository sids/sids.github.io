		<description>@sri,

That argument definitely lacks credibility (and logic!). I was working without the latter half of it.</description>

		<description>Well, I think the argument itself lacks credibility (not to mention the person) if it says, &quot;It is meaningless to say I am proud of being an Indian because my being born here was an accident of birth, but I am proud of being an American.&quot; 

It is somewhat like saying, &quot;I hope the rich childless couple over there adopts me as their child, because me being born to my parents is only an accident of birth..&quot;</description>

		<description>@Sagar,
Reg. the first commenter: I doubt that it&#039;s a (failed) attempt at sarcasm. It is rather easy to find people who don&#039;t even attempt to understand anything that does not agree with his/her own mindset.

@sri,
I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re referring to anyone in particular, but I completely agree with you. I get very annoyed when people who have left India for good start preaching us the &quot;right behaviour&quot; as if they are sitting on a higher pedestal.

But I will add this: In the spirit of argumentation, the credibility (or the lack of it thereof) of the person making the argument should not by itself be a reason to reject an argument. Of course, we can always use the lack of credibility as an excuse to chose not to argue with the person :)</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t have a problem when someone says that he is not proud of being an Indian because he&#039;d rather have the country proud of him. 

But I do have a problem when they go on to say that they are proud to be an American, have willingly taken up its legal identity, and are willing to take arms for its sake. There is a technical term for such an outlook -- a mercenary. I&#039;m not too proud of mercenaries either. When such folks say that it is meaningless to say, I&#039;m proud to be an Indian, sorry it lacks credibility big time.</description>

		<description>This is a tricky issue. I fully agree with you regarding the mindset that we should have - &quot;Strive to make your country proud of you&quot;. But regarding this fervor that people flaunt (sic) on the three national holidays (only) I think it would be very confusing if it weren&#039;t there :)

PS: ROFL at the previous comment. He has either NOT read the content or it is a pathetic attempt at being sarcastic. Either way the comment is a waste.</description>
