		<description>I choosed clojure too because it seems beautiful and straightforward and it is completely different from java but you can use all this ugly code
Haskell is beautiful too but in a kind of complex beauty.
You can take a look to my delicious clojure tag to get links...

		<description>I&#039;ve tried Erlang and found it pretty neat. The code is pretty understandable once you are able to wrap your head around the language&#039;s idiosyncrasies. Though we have nothing in production I am really looking forward to pushing Mochiweb for one of our production environments.

Looking forward to hearing more about your Clojure experiences.</description>

		<description>Go for scala ! :) Its hybrid and best of both the worlds. Pattern Matching is one feature tat counted me in.

If you really want to learn a lot about FP then Haskell is the way to go. But i&#039;m yet to hear any real world system based on Haskell (May be my ignorance ). 

Clojure has some nice data struts . If you like/from lisp dialect, you are choice is correct :)</description>

		<description>For me, FP is pretty hard to understand. However, I clearly see the advantages of it. All the best to you. 

I was (once) very much enthu about learning Haskel. Guess sometime later :-)

But please share the experiences -- I love comparisons as I am not very loyal to any language or technology. Will switch for productivity :-)</description>
