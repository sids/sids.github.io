		<description>@sri,

Thank you for the advice. It was really not my intention to pick on this website in particular.

But since the screenshot I presented here does corroborate what I say in the rest of the post, I&#039;m going to take it off. Thank you again.</description>

		<description>&lt;em&gt;It seems I wasn’t quick enough in taking the screenshot. There were a lot of those mistakes when they announced the venture on Hacker News. Almost every commenter there pointed them out and that seems to have forced the website maintainers to actually fix the mistakes!&lt;/em&gt;

Hmm.. all I can say is that be careful not to get into mob dynamics and pass hasty judgements.. 

Guess you are aware that this particular post is vulnerable against a defamation lawsuit. Prima facie, you&#039;re defaming a particular website and accusing them of sloppiness, when there is no such sloppiness in the very evidence that you provide! 

Citing some mob earlier who&#039;d descended on them earlier does not absolve you of the defamation content present in this post..

Just a word of caution..</description>

Nevertheless, these mistakes are dime a dozen across a good lot of the websites of Indian startups. I would rather not point them out.</description>

		<description>Er.. where do you find those mistakes you mention (spelling mistakes, errors in the usage of it&#039;s and its, etc.) in the website? I read it several times over.. Am I missing something?</description>
