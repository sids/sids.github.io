		<description>Its rare I see Indians take interest in the Lisp family of languages. 

&quot;Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot&quot;

I would actually stay with lisp for its power of abstractions and speak in terms of the problem. Having spent some time LISP I can see how OOP and so many other mainstream concepts were some Lispers&#039; ideas and how many such ideas are waiting to be created

		<description>Interesting post that also inspires, intrigues to try my hand at it too.
Looking forward for your open source library announcement &amp; your Clojure posts. Thanks.</description>
