<p>Just love the scene. It is one of those rare magical moments in the movies.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, this is a scene in the first of the Superman movies. In fact this is the first time Superman is seen on screen; he catches Louis mid air while she is falling from a tall building and the above conversation ensues.</p>
<p>I got reminded of this when HBO played the movie recently.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends.</p>
<p>I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of it? A death. What&#8217;s that, a bonus?!</p>
<p>I think the life cycle is all backwards.</p>
<p>You should die first, get it out of the way.<br />
Then you go live in an old age home.<br />
You get kicked out for being too healthy, go collect your pension, then, when you start work, you get a gold watch on your first day.<br />
You work forty years until you&#8217;re young enough to enjoy your retirement.<br />
You drink alcohol, you party, and you get ready for high school.<br />
You go to primary school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities.<br />
You become a little baby, you go back, spend your last 9 months floating with luxuries like central heating, spa, room service on tap.</p>
<p>Then you finish off as an orgasm!</p>
<p>- Some brilliant guy</p>
<p>(I got this forwarded on email).</p>

				<!--<h5>October 22nd, 2007 by sids</h5>-->

				<div class="entry">
					<p>For the record.</p>
<p>I was supposed to fly KingFisher this morning. I arrived at the airport only to be told that I didn&#8217;t have a booking. This, despite me being issued a PNR.</p>
<p>My story: I booked the flight online on the <em>airline&#8217;s website</em> on Thursday using my credit card and got the PNR, which drew me to the <em>obvious</em> assumption that I had the flight booked. Due to lack of any communication from KingFisher, I held on to my assumption until it got squashed this morning on my arrival at the airport.</p>
<p>Their story: <em>After</em> issuing me the PNR, they found out that the credit card transaction didn&#8217;t go through. They called me on 19th and I didn&#8217;t answer the phone. They cancelled my flight.</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<p>1. I was never made aware that my credit card transaction didn&#8217;t go through. The way any <em>sane</em> online credit card transaction works is this. They take my credit card details, verify that the payment <em>can</em> go through, record the transaction with the payment gateway and <em>then</em> issue the confirmation to me. Not KingFisher&#8217;s, it seems. They somehow decided that the way the rest of the world does things does not suit them.</p>
<p>2. They called me. Once. I was in a meeting and didn&#8217;t answer. I didn&#8217;t know the call was from KingFisher and didn&#8217;t call back. The customer service now tells me that they <em>expect</em> me to call back. <em>Expect</em>. I get loads of marketing calls everyday and usually don&#8217;t bother calling back unknown numbers.</p>
<p>3. They cancelled my booking and didn&#8217;t think it is important enough to inform me.</p>
<p>4. No email or SMS communication was made. None at all.</p>
<p>5. No one is even apologising for all the screw ups, they are acting as if they were doing me a great favour by letting me book the flight in the first place.</p>
<p>6. They are not able/willing to tell me what went wrong with the credit card transaction. I definitely have credit available on it &#8212; I just purchased a ticket on the very same card.</p>
<p>7. I am wasting an entire day and some money because <em>KingFisher Airlines has such retarded processes</em>.</p>
<p>PS: I am at the airport now, waiting for my flight in the afternoon. I am using the Airtel Mobile Office to go online from the airport. This rocks.</p>
<p>PS 2: Why is it that not one person making the announcements here in the airport is able to blurt out a single sentence without faltering?</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I was at the Yahoo! Open Hack Day this weekend with my friend and colleague <a href="http://enkirukkal.blogspot.com/">Sundar</a>. For the most part, it was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>The hacking started at 5pm on Friday and went on till 5pm on Saturday. I had finished my hacks by late night and got really bored from then. Tired too. It seems I am becoming old quite fast! There were times when I <strike>could</strike> did go without without sleep for 60 hours straight and here I was tired in just half as much.</p>
<p>I did a couple hacks by myself:<a href="http://www.grok.in/hacks/google-search-assist/"><span></span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.grok.in/hacks/google-search-assist/"><span>Google Search Assist</span></a>: An implementation of Yahoo! Search Assist for Google. Well, almost.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grok.in/hacks/delicious-tag-management/"><span>Del.icio.us Tag Management</span></a>: A set of ruby scripts that allow you to deal with your tags in del.icio.us in a more automated fashion. The first script identifies duplicates like â€œmovieâ€ and â€œmoviesâ€, asks you which to keep and automatically renames all tags accordingly. The second script allows you to keep del.icio.us tag bundles updated.</p>
<p>and helped Sundar a bit with another hack:</p>
<p>Zooky: Find precise answers related to local, movies, restaurants, ringtones, ATMs, and a lot more info. You can also ask or tell your friends about your find! All from within Y! Messenger whether they&#8217;re online or not. We&#8217;ll probably be releasing an enhanced version of this in the future.</p>
<p>I won the <span style="font-weight: bold">Best â€œReally Needs an Interfaceâ€ hack</span> award for the del.icio.us tag. <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/">Christian Heilmann</a>, a UI guru from Yahoo! UK gave me a book (that he co-wrote) as the prize. The book is, aptly, about web interfaces. Thanks, Chris!</p>
<p>Even better than the award was a comment I got about the same del.icio.us hack: &#8220;that&#8217;s the only hack among all the hacks here that I see myself using.&#8221; Thanks, Naseer!</p>
<p>Check out all the hacks that were presented, there sure were some very interesting ones: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2007/10/results_of_the.html">results of the Open Hack Day Bangalore 2007</a>.</p>
