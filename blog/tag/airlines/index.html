					<p>For the record.</p>
<p>I was supposed to fly KingFisher this morning. I arrived at the airport only to be told that I didn&#8217;t have a booking. This, despite me being issued a PNR.</p>
<p>My story: I booked the flight online on the <em>airline&#8217;s website</em> on Thursday using my credit card and got the PNR, which drew me to the <em>obvious</em> assumption that I had the flight booked. Due to lack of any communication from KingFisher, I held on to my assumption until it got squashed this morning on my arrival at the airport.</p>
<p>Their story: <em>After</em> issuing me the PNR, they found out that the credit card transaction didn&#8217;t go through. They called me on 19th and I didn&#8217;t answer the phone. They cancelled my flight.</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<p>1. I was never made aware that my credit card transaction didn&#8217;t go through. The way any <em>sane</em> online credit card transaction works is this. They take my credit card details, verify that the payment <em>can</em> go through, record the transaction with the payment gateway and <em>then</em> issue the confirmation to me. Not KingFisher&#8217;s, it seems. They somehow decided that the way the rest of the world does things does not suit them.</p>
<p>2. They called me. Once. I was in a meeting and didn&#8217;t answer. I didn&#8217;t know the call was from KingFisher and didn&#8217;t call back. The customer service now tells me that they <em>expect</em> me to call back. <em>Expect</em>. I get loads of marketing calls everyday and usually don&#8217;t bother calling back unknown numbers.</p>
<p>3. They cancelled my booking and didn&#8217;t think it is important enough to inform me.</p>
<p>4. No email or SMS communication was made. None at all.</p>
<p>5. No one is even apologising for all the screw ups, they are acting as if they were doing me a great favour by letting me book the flight in the first place.</p>
<p>6. They are not able/willing to tell me what went wrong with the credit card transaction. I definitely have credit available on it &#8212; I just purchased a ticket on the very same card.</p>
<p>7. I am wasting an entire day and some money because <em>KingFisher Airlines has such retarded processes</em>.</p>
<p>PS: I am at the airport now, waiting for my flight in the afternoon. I am using the Airtel Mobile Office to go online from the airport. This rocks.</p>
<p>PS 2: Why is it that not one person making the announcements here in the airport is able to blurt out a single sentence without faltering?</p>
