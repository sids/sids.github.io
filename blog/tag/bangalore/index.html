					<p><a title="Cafe Terra, Koramangala, Bangalore" href="http://www.cafe-terra.com/index.html">Cafe Terra</a> in Koramangala is now my favourite restaurant in Bangalore. If you enjoy European food, you&#8217;ll love it too.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got the full blown English breakfast — Scrambled eggs, Toast, Sausages, Fried Potato and of course, Tea. There&#8217;s also a Belgian variety which comes with Waffles and/or Muffins. Just perfect for a laid back weekend breakfast.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let the name fool you though, it&#8217;s a pretty good lunch/dinner place too. They&#8217;ve got a nice selection of omelettes (try the Chicken or the Ham &amp; Mushroom varieties) and an omelette here is a meal in itself. The menu is not restricted to European food only: they have got some finger-licking good Thai, Sri Lankan(!), Tibetan, etc. dishes too. Have a look at the (nearly) <a title="Cafe Terra, Koramangala, Bangalore - Meny" href="http://www.cafe-terra.com/menu.html">complete menu</a> at their website.</p>
<p>The food, excellent as it is, is not the only thing going for the place. The ambience is unbeatable. It&#8217;s a small room with six to seven simple tables surrounded by a sober decor and you tend to feel relaxed the moment you enter it. And it&#8217;s got a reasonably good collection of comic books to keep you company. Whatanidea!</p>
<p>The place is nearly empty most of the time. This has gotten me worried that it might close down <img src='http://www.sids.in/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> . So I&#8217;ve decided to patronise it, even at the risk of getting too many people there thus spoiling the very thing I like about it. You can find directions to get there at their <a title="Cafe Terra, Koramangala, Bangalore" href="http://www.cafe-terra.com/index.html">website</a>.</p>

					<p>&#8230;a place where you can pick up girls on IRC!</p>
<p>Lately I have become quite fond of one line descriptions of anything and everything. Thinking of Bangalore this morning, this struck me.</p>
<p>No, really, it actually happened to me! No, I did not pick up any girl on IRC: I was lurking around on #bangalore on DALNet when this dude PMs me with &#8220;ASL?&#8221;; he was there to pick up girls and told me as much. I don&#8217;t know if he met with any success, but Bangalore is one of the few cities where he actually has a chance.</p>

					<p>I was at the Yahoo! Open Hack Day this weekend with my friend and colleague <a href="http://enkirukkal.blogspot.com/">Sundar</a>. For the most part, it was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>The hacking started at 5pm on Friday and went on till 5pm on Saturday. I had finished my hacks by late night and got really bored from then. Tired too. It seems I am becoming old quite fast! There were times when I <strike>could</strike> did go without without sleep for 60 hours straight and here I was tired in just half as much.</p>
<p>I did a couple hacks by myself:<a href="http://www.grok.in/hacks/google-search-assist/"><span></span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.grok.in/hacks/google-search-assist/"><span>Google Search Assist</span></a>: An implementation of Yahoo! Search Assist for Google. Well, almost.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grok.in/hacks/delicious-tag-management/"><span>Del.icio.us Tag Management</span></a>: A set of ruby scripts that allow you to deal with your tags in del.icio.us in a more automated fashion. The first script identifies duplicates like â€œmovieâ€ and â€œmoviesâ€, asks you which to keep and automatically renames all tags accordingly. The second script allows you to keep del.icio.us tag bundles updated.</p>
<p>and helped Sundar a bit with another hack:</p>
<p>Zooky: Find precise answers related to local, movies, restaurants, ringtones, ATMs, and a lot more info. You can also ask or tell your friends about your find! All from within Y! Messenger whether they&#8217;re online or not. We&#8217;ll probably be releasing an enhanced version of this in the future.</p>
<p>I won the <span style="font-weight: bold">Best â€œReally Needs an Interfaceâ€ hack</span> award for the del.icio.us tag. <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/">Christian Heilmann</a>, a UI guru from Yahoo! UK gave me a book (that he co-wrote) as the prize. The book is, aptly, about web interfaces. Thanks, Chris!</p>
<p>Even better than the award was a comment I got about the same del.icio.us hack: &#8220;that&#8217;s the only hack among all the hacks here that I see myself using.&#8221; Thanks, Naseer!</p>
<p>Check out all the hacks that were presented, there sure were some very interesting ones: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2007/10/results_of_the.html">results of the Open Hack Day Bangalore 2007</a>.</p>

					<p>The weather, I mean. But with such a climate one cannot really experience anything else. I was at <a href="http://proto.in/">proto.in</a> for the last couple of days and couldn&#8217;t wait to get back into an air-conditioned room not five minutes after I was out of one. So basically, Chennai weather sucks. Big time. Most terrible. Un-liveable. Even Hyderabad weather sucks way less than Chennai&#8217;s. Enough said.</p>
