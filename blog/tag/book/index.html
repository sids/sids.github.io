<div class="snap_preview">Oscar Wilde in the preface to <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>:</div>
<div class="snap_preview"></div>
<div class="snap_preview">
<blockquote style="text-indent: 1.5em;"><p>The artist is the creator of beautiful things.</p>
<p>To reveal art and to conceal the artist is art’s aim.</p>
<p>The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.</p>
<p>The highest, as the lowest, form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.</p>
<p>Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.</p>
<p>Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope.</p>
<p>They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.</p>
<p>The nineteenth-century dislike of Realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.</p>
<p>The nineteenth-century dislike of Romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.</p>
<p>The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved.</p>
<p>No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.</p>
<p>No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything.</p>
<p>Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art.</p>
<p>Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.</p>
<p>From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the type.</p>
<p>All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.</p>
<p>It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.</p>
<p>When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself.</p>
<p>We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.</p>
<p>All art is quite useless.</p></blockquote>
<p>I just started reading <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, with a lot of expectations.</div>

					<p>An excerpt from Salman Rushdie&#8217;s latest, &#8216;The Enchantress of Florence&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><p>The emperor Abul-Fath Jalaluddin Muhammad, king of kings, known since his childhood as Akbar, meaning &#8216;the great&#8217;, and latterly, in spite of the tautology of it, as Akbar the Great, the great great one, great in his greatness, doubly great, so great that the repetition in his title was not only appropriate but necessary in order to express the gloriousness of his glory — the Grand Mughal, the dusty, battle-weary, victorious, pensive, incipiently overweight, disenchanted, mustachioed, poetic, over-sexed, and absolute emperor, who seemed altogether too magnificent, too world-encompassing, and, in sum, too <em>much</em> to be a single human personage — this all-engulfing flood of a ruler, this swallower of worlds, this many-headed monster who referred to himself in the first person plural — had begun to meditate, during his long, tedious journey home, on which he was accompanied by the heads of his defeated enemies bobbing in their sealed earthen pickle-jars, about the disturbing possibilities of the first person singular — the &#8216;I&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m through less than a fifth of the book and I already love it!</p>
