				<small>Friday, August 1st, 2008</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Do you print all the emails that you receive? Any of them?</p>
<p>I have never printed an email. Never. Ever. Evar. That&#8217;s probably why it infuriates me to no end when I see something like the following at the end of one:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail. Thank you.</p></blockquote>
<p>These self-appointed guardians of the environment are the same people who drive the fuel-guzzling Yamaha R15s, who sit in a closed office with the air-conditioner set to 24 C when the temperature outside is exactly the same, who keep the water running when they are wiping that measly beard off their faces, who&#8230; you get the point.</p>
<p>This is the exact kind of <em>holier-than-thou</em> attitude I despise. The obvious implication of them adding that line at the end of every email they send me is that they consider me to be a snob who cares shi*t for the environment. Yo! you&#8217;re living in a house with glass walls, stop throwing stones at me.</p>
<p>Actually, I might be wrong. Maybe they are not sporting that despicable attitude. Maybe they are just plain stupid.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong with a single line at the end of an email?&#8221;, you&#8217;re clearly not seeing the big picture my friend. Think of all the bandwidth these lines waste. If you don&#8217;t think it is much, just think of all the sleaze you could&#8217;ve downloaded instead of those stupid lines. Ah, now you see! Of course, don&#8217;t forget all the time you&#8217;ve wasted reading all those stupid lines. Think of how much sleaze you could&#8217;ve watched in that time. Do I see enlightenment in those eyes of yours? <img src='http://www.sids.in/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>More than anything else, those lines are plain insulting. If you are one of the accused, please, for the love of the environment, stop giving gyan in your emails. The world does not need it. Certainly not from you.</p>
