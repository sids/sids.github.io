<div class="snap_preview">Oscar Wilde in the preface to <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>:</div>
<div class="snap_preview"></div>
<div class="snap_preview">
<blockquote style="text-indent: 1.5em;"><p>The artist is the creator of beautiful things.</p>
<p>To reveal art and to conceal the artist is art’s aim.</p>
<p>The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.</p>
<p>The highest, as the lowest, form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.</p>
<p>Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.</p>
<p>Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope.</p>
<p>They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.</p>
<p>The nineteenth-century dislike of Realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.</p>
<p>The nineteenth-century dislike of Romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.</p>
<p>The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved.</p>
<p>No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.</p>
<p>No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything.</p>
<p>Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art.</p>
<p>Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.</p>
<p>From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the type.</p>
<p>All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.</p>
<p>It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.</p>
<p>Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.</p>
<p>When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself.</p>
<p>We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.</p>
<p>All art is quite useless.</p></blockquote>
<p>I just started reading <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, with a lot of expectations.</div>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There was a very interesting thread a couple of days ago on StackOverflow (great site, by the way) on &#8220;Great Programming Quotes&#8221; and it got some great responses. <a title="Great Programming Quotes" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/58640/great-programming-quotes">Read it here</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a selection of some of my own favorite geek quotes. Most of them are from the Bugzilla quip list I created at work (hence the flavor). I&#8217;m mostly posting these for my own future reference.</p>
<hr />
<p>Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it. (Donald Knuth)</p>
<p>Anything that happens happens, anything that in happening causes something else to happen causes something else to happen, and anything that in happening causes itself to happen again, happens again. Although not necessarily in chronological order. (Douglas Adams)</p>
<p>&#8211; Why do we have to hide from the police, daddy?<br />
&#8211; Because we use vi, son. They use emacs.<br />
(via Michael Crawford)</p>
<p>One should expect that the expected can be prevented, but the unexpected should have been expected. (Norman Augustine)</p>
<p>I never guess. It is a shocking habit &#8212; destructive to the logical faculty. (&#8220;Sherlock Holmes&#8221;)</p>
<p>When trouble is solved before it forms, who calls that clever? (Sun Tzu)</p>
<p>The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair. (Douglas Adams)</p>
<p>I have not failed. I&#8217;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&#8217;t work. (Thomas Edison)</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn&#8217;t matter how smart you are. If it doesn&#8217;t agree with experiment, it&#8217;s wrong. (Richard Feynman)</p>
<p>In his errors a man is true to type. Observe the errors and you will know the man. (Kong Fu Zi aka Confucius)</p>
<p>Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better. (Samuel Beckett)</p>
<p>All sorts of computer errors are now turning up. You&#8217;d be surprised to know the number of doctors who claim they are treating pregnant men. (Isaac Asimov)</p>
<p>I never make stupid mistakes. Only very, very clever ones. (&#8220;Dr Who&#8221;)</p>
<p>Lance: If you&#8217;re all right, then say something. Mia: Something.</p>
<p>Two men say they’re Jesus, one of them must be wrong. (Dire Straits, &#8220;Industrial Disease&#8221;)</p>
<p>Dont like this bug? Hit the escape button.</p>
<p>If I had asked my customers what they wanted they would have said a faster horse. (Henry Ford)</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t sure if something is a bug, that&#8217;s a bug. Please file a bug and mention your uncertainty in the bug report. (Tabriz, Sun Engineer)</p>

					<p>He says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry miss, I&#8217;ve got you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got me?! Who&#8217;s got you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just love the scene. It is one of those rare magical moments in the movies.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, this is a scene in the first of the Superman movies. In fact this is the first time Superman is seen on screen; he catches Louis mid air while she is falling from a tall building and the above conversation ensues.</p>
<p>I got reminded of this when HBO played the movie recently.</p>
